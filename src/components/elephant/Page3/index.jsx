              The Asian elephant plays an important role in the forest and grasslands ecosystem. This is because they help to maintain the health of these habitats. Asian elephants eat many different plants, and as they travel around their dung is dropped, which is filled with many different seeds. They help spread plants around the environment, which helps to keep the ecosystem diverse. This is important because it keeps the habitat healthy which benefits the many animals that live there.

            <p>
            Asian elephants also play an important role in maintaining the grasslands. The grass in this environment can get very long, which makes it hard for small animals to travel through. Because of the Asian elephantâ€™s large size, they are able to create paths in the grass for smaller animals.
